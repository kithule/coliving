This GitHub serves as a beginner-friendly app idea for me to learn Django.

# 🏡 Coliving – A web app built for harmonious shared living (hopefully)

🚀 **Live Demo**: [View the app on Render](https://ihatemyflatmates.onrender.com)

## ✨ Features

### 1. Anonymous Notes
- Leave anonymous messages for your flatmates.
- Ideal for expressing concerns (e.g. flatmate blasting techno at 2am) without triggering personal conflicts.

### 2. Chore Management
- Create and assign household tasks with deadlines, assignees, and status updates.

### 3. Group Chat
- Real-time group chat for all flatmates using **Django websockets**
